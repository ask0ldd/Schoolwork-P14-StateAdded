This school project involved converting some aging JQuery plugins to react.

I was tasled to choose a plugin among the following ones :

- A datatable.
- A custom select.
- A modale.
- A date picker.

However, I decided to exceed expectations and ended up converting three of these plugins.

As a result, the datatable, custom select, and modal will soon have their own repositories and be available on NPM.

The datatable can already be found here :
